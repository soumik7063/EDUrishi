EDUrishi conducts after-school tuition for children from weaker sections of the society. These children cannot afford private tutoring. Foundationâ€™s goal is to ensure that financial constraints do not hinder their access to quality education and opportunities for future growth.

The curriculum itself plays a pivotal role. It should be engaging, relevant, and adaptable to cater to diverse learning styles and needs. Integrating technology, incorporating real-world applications, and encouraging student involvement in the learning process are key ingredients for a stimulating and effective curriculum.

The pursuit of quality education is a continuous journey, demanding ongoing evaluation and adaptation. Regularly assessing learning outcomes, incorporating innovative approaches, and fostering a culture of collaboration are crucial to ensure that education remains relevant and impactful.

We aim to address this issue of providing quality education to the underprivileged section of the society after their school hours. This would not only aim to make them enjoy their learning process but would also aim to address the future job opportunities that they could avail and improve the poverty levels of our country.
